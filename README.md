# Hey there 👋 Welcome!

## A little bit about me....

<p>
  <img width="250" align='right' src="https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Kuriankkr/blob/main/Images/Data_Science.jpg">
</p>


I am an Industrial Engineering graduate at **<img src= "https://github.com/Kuriankkr/Kuriankkr/blob/main/Images/Ohio_st.png" width="20">**  with a background in **operations research and data analytics**. I work as a part time **student research assistant** applying predicitive modelling techniques in material science domain.

I like to identify challenging problems that I face around me and try coming up with possible solutions with the skill sets that I have. More often that not! I end up realizing I have to read more, learn more, code more when tackling these problems and this is why I love the field I work in! When I am not coding, I try my luck on my 🎻 and and some new dishes 🍕 

Below are some of my personal projects and capstone projects (as a part of online courses thaT I have undertaken) that I would like the world to see!

It involved sourcing the data from Kaggle as a part of a competition and predicting the sales price of Bulldozers that we being sold during an auction.
